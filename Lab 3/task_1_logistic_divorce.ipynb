    "### Logistic regression\n",
    "Logistic regression uses an equation as the representation, very much like linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input values (x) are combined linearly using weights or coefficient values (referred to as W) to predict an output value (y). A key difference from linear regression is that the output value being modeled is a binary values (0 or 1) rather than a continuous value.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "###  $\\hat{y}(w, x) = \\frac{1}{1+exp^{-(w_0 + w_1 * x_1 + ... + w_p * x_p)}}$\n",

    "1. Atr1 - If one of us apologizes when our discussion deteriorates, the discussion ends. (Numeric | Range: 0-4)\n",
    "2. Atr2 - I know we can ignore our differences, even if things get hard sometimes. (Numeric | Range: 0-4)\n",

    "55. Class: (Binary | 1 => Divorced, 0 => Not divorced yet)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "To gain understanding of logistic regression through implementing the model from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tasks\n",
    "- Download and load the data (csv file contains ';' as delimiter)\n",
    "- Add column at position 0 with all values=1 (pandas.DataFrame.insert function). This is for input to the bias $w_0$\n",
    "- Define X matrix (independent features) and y vector (target feature) as numpy arrays\n",
    "- Print the shape and datatype of both X and y\n",
    "[//]: # \"- Dataset contains missing values, hence fill the missing values (NA) by performing missing value prediction\"\n",
    "[//]: # \"- Since the all the features are in higher range, columns can be normalized into smaller scale (like 0 to 1) using different methods such as scaling, standardizing or any other suitable preprocessing technique (sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler)\"\n",
    "- Split the dataset into 85% for training and rest 15% for testing (sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split function)\n",
    "- Follow logistic regression class and fill code where highlighted:\n",
    "    - Write sigmoid function to predict probabilities\n",
    "    - Write log likelihood function\n",
    "    - Write fit function where gradient ascent is implemented\n",
    "    - Write predict_proba function where we predict probabilities for input data\n",
    "- Train the model\n",
    "- Write function for calculating accuracy\n",
    "- Compute accuracy on train and test data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further Fun (will not be evaluated)\n",
    "- Play with learning rate and max_iterations\n",
    "- Preprocess data with different feature scaling methods (i.e. scaling, normalization, standardization, etc) and observe accuracies on both X_train and X_test\n",
    "- Train model on different train-test splits such as 60-40, 50-50, 70-30, 80-20, 90-10, 95-5 etc. and observe accuracies on both X_train and X_test\n",
    "- Shuffle training samples with different random seed values in the train_test_split function. Check the model error for the testing data for each setup.\n",
    "- Print other classification metrics such as:\n",
    "    - classification report (sklearn.metrics.classification_report),\n",
    "    - confusion matrix (sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix),\n",
    "    - precision, recall and f1 scores (sklearn.metrics.precision_recall_fscore_support)\n",
